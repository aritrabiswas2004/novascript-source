[NovaScript](https://xkcd.com/927/) is a 
dynamically-typed, multi-paradigm and interpreted programming language with support
for both functional and object-oriented programming.
The language interpreter is written in TypeScript. 
The aim of NovaScript is to do data science and statistical programming in a 
clean and easy to understand/implement syntax.

This project was done with help from the 
[Guide to Interpreters](https://github.com/tlaceby/guide-to-interpreters-series) by Tyler Laceby 
on creating a programming language from scratch and also
the comical [Bussin language by Face Dev](https://github.com/face-hh/bussin/tree/main). There is also an honourable mention to
the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book by Robert Nystrom.

This README file great information for your first
experience with NovaScript.

This project is not being actively maintained anymore, please read the [closing remarks](./configdocs/CLOSING_NOTES.md).

## Running

### **`v0.4.0` now has a public [Docker Image](./configdocs/DOCKER.md)**

NovaScript can be explored by two different modes just
like other interpreted languages like JavaScript using
Node.js or Python.
As of now running the language requires Node.js to be
installed on your system. This is subject to change 
when the project is compiled to
an executable.

- **Interactive Mode**
  - Interactive mode executes a NovaScript program 
    and returns the result
    line-by-line.
  - This can be activated by including no NovaScript 
    files as program arguments
    when running the `npm run dev` command.
- **Script Mode**
  - This is when an entire file of code is read an 
    executed by the interpreter. All NovaScript files 
    must have a `.nv` extension.
    This is done by passing a NovaScript file to 
    the `npm run dev` argument. Like
    `npm run dev -- source.nv`.

> To run either mode in a development configuration for
> debugging or development purposes, refer to the
> [Development Setup](./configdocs/SETUP.md).

## Syntax and Features

NovaScript already supports some basic features but 
more support for certain statements and expression 
are soon
to be added. The features to be included in the 
future are given in a TODO list below.

> [!WARNING]
> In NovaScript version v0.1.0, all outputs to the 
> console print in Debug print. To print in
> Release print check the [builtins docs](./documentation/BUILTINS.md)
> for more information.

### Variables

Variables can be declared with the `mut` keyword. 
This makes the variable mutable and re-assignable.
Variable names must have only letters a-z or A-Z 
and cannot have numeric values or special characters.

```javascript
mut foo = 23;
foo = 91;
print(foo); // 91
```

`mut` variables can be declared without assignment

```javascript
mut foo;
foo = 12;
print(foo); // 12
```

By using the `const` keyword, the variable becomes 
immutable. `const` variables cannot be declared 
without a value.

```javascript
const foo = 23;
foo = 34; // Throws error
```

### Binary Expression

NovaScript supports Numeric Binary Expressions 
of `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and `%`;

```javascript
const foo = 12 + 45;
print(foo); // 57
```

As an extension of Binary Expressions, comparison 
expression are also handled such as
`==`, `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`, `!=`.

```javascript
const foo = 1 + 4;
const bar = 2 + 1;

print(foo == bar) // false
print(foo >= bar) // true
print(foo <= bar) // false
print(foo > bar)  // true
print(foo < bar)  // false
```

### Objects

NovaScript has the option to create objects in the 
iconic
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) type format. Any
Expression can be defined by using a colon `:` after any
identifier name.

Objects members can be accessed using the `.` operator.

```javascript
const foo = {
  bar: "hello world",
  firstVar: 13,
  complex : {
    insideVar: 14,
    secondVar: 15
  }
};

print(foo.bar) // hello world
print(foo.complex.insideVar) // 14
```

### Boolean Expressions

Boolean Expression are part of global constants and 
can be assigned to variables.

```javascript
const foo = true;
const bar = false;
print(foo); // true
print(bar); // false
```

### Null Expression

Just like Boolean Expressions, Null Expressions can 
also be assigned to variables. Using a Binary 
Expression with a null value returns a null value.

```javascript
const foo = null;
const bar = 2 + foo;

print(foo); // null
print(bar); // null
```

### Native Functions (Builtins)

This documentation for this portion is in the 
`BUILTINS.md` file which can be found [here](./configdocs/documentation/BUILTINS.md).

### User-defined Functions

Functions can also be defined by the programmer using 
the `func` keyword. NovaScript supports taking function
arguments and
implementing them. A `return` keyword is unnecessary
and simply writing the variable/object to be returned
in the last line of the function is enough.

```javascript
func add(x, y) {
    const value = x + y;
    value; // No need for return keyword
}

func sub(x, y){
    const value = x - y;
    return value;
}

const res = add(10, 4);
const res2 = sub(10, 4);

print(res); // 14
print(res2); // 6
```

### Comments

Comments on NovaScript are single lined or multi-lined.
Comments are not included in parsing and are thrown out
by the lexer itself.
As seen on the code-block above and below, the use 
of comments can be in any place. Single line comments
begin with the `//` symbol and multi-line comments
begin with the `/(` token and end with the `)/` token.

```javascript
/(

this is
a multi-line
comment

)/

// this is a single line comment
// this is another comment

print(10000) // ignore this
```

### If-Else Statements

NovaScript has `if-else` statements functionality 
similar to those of JavaScript. Since block statements
are now simplified,
a block will only be read if the expression passed
returns a boolean value of true. If a non-boolean 
expression is entered after the `if` statement then 
the default value is evaluated as `false`.

```javascript
const foo = 3;
const bar = 2;

if (foo < bar) {
    print(100);
} else if (foo == bar) {
    print(300);
} else {
    print(200);
}

// Prints 200
```

### While Loops

`while` loops are supported in NovaScript. A block 
statement is repeated until the condition given in 
the while loop is `false`. The block of code
under a while has its own namespace. 

```javascript
mut foo = 1;

while (foo < 10){
    foo = foo + 1;
}

print(foo); // 10
```

### For Loops

`for` loops are counting loops and the iterations of
the loop are independent of any other variables outside
the loop scope. For loops are declared in the order 
of - [var declaration, boolean condition, update statement].
A `for` loop will
iterate with the update as long as the condition 
remains true.

```javascript
for (mut i = 1; i <= 10; i = i + 1){
    print(i);
}

// Outputs numbers 1 ... 10
```

### Until Loops

Just like the Ruby Programming language, NovaScript 
has `until` loops. In this loop a block of code loops
until the expression after the until statement
becomes `true`. It is basically the opposite of the 
`while` loop.

```javascript
mut i = 1;

until (i == 10) {
    print(i);
    i = i + 1;
}

// Prints 1 ... 9
```

### Strings

There is now strings support in NovaScript. Strings are
sequences of alphanumeric ASCII characters. The maximum
length of a string is 2147483647 characters
(`2^53 - 1`), the same as JavaScript. Strings are 
declared with the double quotation mark (`"`). Strings
now also support ASCII escape sequences such as `\n` as 
newline, `\t` for tab whitespaces and `\r` for carriage return.

```javascript
const foo = "foo";
const bar = "bar";
const result = concat(foo, bar);

print(result); // prints "foobar"
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Escape sequences only can be observed in Release 
> print and not Debug print. 
> See [`native-builtins.ts`](./runtime/native-builtins.ts) `printFunction()` for
> print definition and [`BUILTINS.md`](./documentation/BUILTINS.md) for documentation.

### Arrays

Arrays are a sequences of primary expressions which 
can be useful to store organised data whose values are 
needed to constantly be looked-up and used. 
Syntactically, NovaScript
arrays are the same as JavaScript arrays. Arrays begin
with the opening bracket `[` and end with `]` with 
primary expression values seperated by commas `,`.

```javascript
const foo = [1, 2, 3, "bar", ["foobar", "true"], true];

print(foo); // [1, 2, 3, "bar", ["foobar", "true"], true]
```
Arrays can also be indexed with indexing starting at 0.
Array indexing can also be used
simultaneously to access nested literals.

```javascript
const foo = [1, 2, 3, "bar", ["foobar", "true"], true];

print(foo[0]); // 1
print(foo[4][0]); // "foobar"
```

### Try-Catch Statements

NovaScript now has `try-catch` statements. These are 
used for error handling just like JavaScript. Any error
in the `try` block statement
automatically triggers the block statement in `catch` 
to occur. `try` and `catch` keywords
compliment each other and cannot be used separately.

```javascript
try {
    print("The code below throws an error");
    const foo = "foo";
    foo = "bar";
    print("this will not get printed");
} catch {
    print("Error occurred, exception thrown");
}

// Output:
// The code below throws an error
// Error occurred, exception thrown
```

### Import Statements

`import` statements are used to import values from 
other NovaScript files. These values can be Variables 
or Function Call Expressions. 
The syntax for import statements the `import` keyword
followed by the variable/function names
which is finally followed by the path to filename. 
The syntax is identical to that of JavaScript.
The `*` wildcard can be used to import all statements,
variables and functions from a module NovaScript file.

- `module.nv`
```javascript
// module.nv
func squareNum(num){
    num * num; // returns square of a number
}
```

- `main.nv`
```javascript
import {squareNum} from "./path/to/module.nv"

print(squareNum(4)); // 16
```

### Classes

NovaScript now supports limited OOP features, 
specifically those of classes and its methods &
properties. Classes are declared by the `class` 
keyword and contain scoped variables
(known as properties) and scoped function 
(known as methods).

See [CLASSES.md](./documentation/CLASSES.md) for all information regarding Classes and OOP.

A new class is always instantiated by the `new` 
keyword.

```javascript
class Person {
    const name = "foo";
    
    func sayName(){
        const internalName = "fizzbuzz";
        internalName;
    }
}

const bar = new Person();

print(bar.name); // "foo"
print(bar.sayName()) // "fizzbuzz"
```

### Listeners

NovaScript can now start a listener on a port of your choice.
You can specify this with the `startServer()` function.

```javascript
const htmlCode = file.read("index.html");
startServer(htmlCode, 8080);
```

## TODOs

The below items are TODOs that can be added to the 
language to increase its support.
